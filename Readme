The code Sin_data generates forward solution data using an RK-2 time-integration scheme. The required spatial and temporal resolutions are to be set up by the user, along with the output file names. Here, the files 'Solution*' represent the highly resolved data. The h5.keys() allows the user to extract domain, timestep and Solution data.
The code KPP_1D and Backward.py work to generate the backward time data with the spatial resolution provided by the user. Since the equations are posed in 1-D, TDMA is used to compute matrix-vector products required by the inverse problem formulation. The output file names are input in the Backward.py code.
